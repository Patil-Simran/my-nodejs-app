# byte_crunchers
This is the Git repository for Team Byte Crunchers, participating in the MITWPU hackathon. Our repository contains a few components: AiCon V2, the AI model, and the interface for Project PillPal.

Our core concept revolves around developing a personalized application to streamline medication management. Our app offers timely reminders, alerts for medication restocking, doctor recommendations, and a user-friendly interface designed to enhance the healthcare experience, making staying healthy easier, independent and engaging.

**While we faced challenges due to unexpected emergencies and unresponsive internal servers, we believe our presentation successfully conveys the essence of our innovative idea through the accompanying PowerPoint.
